## Introduction
Released 2 years ago in late 2019, Cisco 8201 router has been widely adopted and deployed by service provider and cloud customers for core and peering roles.  

This second article on Cisco 8000 will document how the 8201 can support current BGP scale for a peering or a core role. Based on projection growth, we will check it is sustainable for the next years to come. Last test will push the router to its currently supported limits. Telemetry data will also be used to illustrate its capacities.
